    <p>We have two cats who are six years old and pretty terrible. They are like living with racoons in our house<p>
    <p>Here are some reasons they are terrible:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They sleep all day on my favorite chair</li>
      <li>They wake us up at night</li>
      <li>They scratch at al the furniture</li>
    </ul>
